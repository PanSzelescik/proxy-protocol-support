# Proxy Protocol Support
Proxy Protocol Support is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) mod which adds support for [Proxy Protocol (HAProxy)](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy/proxy-protocol/ "Proxy Protocol (HAProxy)") for your Minecraft server.

For example you can use [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com/ "TCPShield") or other software ([Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_proxy_module.html#proxy_protocol "Nginx")) to forward traffic, and hide your server's IP address. Without Proxy Protocol you can see in console Proxy's IP address. Using and reading Proxy Protocol packet makes showing player's IP address possible.

Server-Side mod only, on the client does nothing!

Supports Minecraft versions 1.14-1.19.2 and probably snapshots (untested)
